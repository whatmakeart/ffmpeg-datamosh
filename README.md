Datamoshing with ffmpeg

Inspired and adapted from [Reddit thread comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/datamoshing/comments/t46x3i/datamoshing_with_ffmpeg_howto_in_comments/) by user [justhadto](https://www.reddit.com/user/justhadto/)

Created using plain language inputs into the ChatGPT o1-preview as an experiment to see if a useable result could be produced. It works better with lower resolution videos but can be run in Google Colab. As LLM's continue to advance, hopefully more software tools can be created by users with plain language instructions so people can create and make the things that they want.

Simplifies a command line process and makes it accessible to folks without ffmpeg installed for use from the command line.
